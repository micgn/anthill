# anthill

Small piece of software originating from a code retreat in Munich. 
Some ants are searching and gathering food, while communicating with each other regarding the best food locations.

I tried to practice pure test driven development here. Mockito, Powermock and Cucumber have been used here. The ants have been 
visualized using GWT.
